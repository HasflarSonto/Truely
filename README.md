# Truely - Dual-Join Process Monitor

A comprehensive macOS application that monitors for suspicious processes and automatically joins Zoom meetings with dual-join capability (both bot and user simultaneously).

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Continuously monitors for suspicious processes (set in `config.py`)
- **Dual-Join Zoom Meetings**: Automatically joins meetings as both a bot and opens Zoom app for user
- **Automated Chat Alerts**: Sends real-time alerts to meeting chat when suspicious processes are detected
- **Automated Introduction Messages**: Bot sends a sequence of introduction messages to the meeting chat, including the monitoring key and the list of monitored applications
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly leaves meetings and cleans up resources on exit

### Automated Introduction Message Sequence
When the bot joins a meeting, it sends the following messages to the chat:

1. `Hello everyone! I'm Truely, your automated meeting monitor.`
2. `Monitoring Key: <KEY>` (where `<KEY>` is set in `config.py`)
3. `I'll be keeping an eye on the following applications and processes during this meeting: app1, app2, ...` (where the list is set in `config.py`)

### Bot Automation
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Headless Chrome automation for Zoom web client
- **Smart Element Detection**: Multiple strategies for finding and interacting with Zoom interface elements
- **Robust Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms for different Zoom interface states
- **Chat Integration**: Opens chat panel and sends messages automatically

### User Interface
- **System Tray Icon**: Always-on-top monitoring with visual alerts
- **Alert Popup**: Prominent warning when suspicious processes detected
- **Status Logging**: Real-time status updates and debugging information
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Popup button triggers full cleanup process

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Process Monitoring
```python
# Monitors for suspicious processes by name, path, and hash
self.process_names = APPS  # Set in config.py
self.suspicious_paths = ["/Applications/Cluely.app/Contents/MacOS/Cluely"]
self.suspicious_hashes = []
```

### Dual-Join Meeting System
```python
# Joins both bot and user to the same meeting
bot_success = self.bot_joiner.join_zoom_meeting_bot(meeting_id, "Truely Bot", passcode)
user_success = self.meeting_joiner.join_zoom_meeting(meeting_id, passcode)
```

### Bot Automation Features
- **Multiple Selector Strategies**: 10+ different XPath selectors for robust element detection
- **Iframe Handling**: Automatically switches to meeting iframe when needed
- **Double-Click Leave**: Properly handles Zoom's highlight-then-leave button behavior
- **JavaScript Fallbacks**: Uses JavaScript clicks when regular clicks fail

### Chat Alert System
```python
# Clean, formatted alerts without HTML tags
alert_message = (
    f"ALERT: SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED [{timestamp}]\n"
    f"{clean_process_info}\n\n"
    "This process has been flagged as potentially suspicious by Truely monitoring system."
)
```

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS (tested on macOS 13+)
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser installed

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install PyQt6 selenium webdriver-manager psutil
```

### Auto-Installation
The application automatically installs Selenium and webdriver-manager if not present:
```python
def install_selenium_if_needed():
    """Automatically install Selenium and webdriver-manager if not available"""
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python3 truely_dual_join.py
```

### Initial Setup
1. **Meeting Setup**: Application prompts for Zoom meeting URL/ID at startup
2. **Dual-Join**: Automatically joins as bot and opens Zoom app for user
3. **Chat Integration**: Opens chat panel and sends introduction message
4. **Monitoring Active**: Continuously monitors for suspicious processes

### Alert System
- **Visual Alert**: Red popup appears when suspicious process detected
- **Chat Alert**: Bot sends formatted alert to meeting chat
- **System Notification**: Tray icon changes and shows notification
- **Cooldown**: 30-second cooldown between alerts to prevent spam

### Shutdown Process
- **Graceful Exit**: Ctrl+C or popup button triggers full cleanup
- **Goodbye Message**: Bot sends "Goodbye everyone! Truely signing off."
- **Leave Meeting**: Double-clicks leave button with proper timing
- **Resource Cleanup**: Closes Selenium driver and stops monitoring

## üîç Key Technical Solutions

### 1. Robust Element Detection
```python
# Multiple strategies for finding leave button
leave_selectors = [
    "//button[@aria-label='Leave']",
    "//button[contains(@class, 'footer-button-base__button') and @aria-label='Leave']",
    "//button[.//span[contains(@class, 'footer-button-base__button-label') and text()='Leave']]",
    "//button[.//svg[contains(@class, 'SvgLeave')]]",
    # ... 10+ more selectors
]
```

### 2. Double-Click Leave Strategy
```python
# Properly handles Zoom's highlight-then-leave behavior
print("Clicking leave button first time (to highlight)...")
leave_button.click()
time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for highlight
print("Clicking leave button second time (to leave)...")
leave_button.click()
```

### 3. HTML Tag Cleaning
```python
# Extracts clean text from HTML-formatted process info
def clean_process_info_for_chat(self, process_info: str) -> str:
    clean_text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', process_info)
    # Returns: [NAME] cluely (PID: 49311)
```

### 4. Graceful Shutdown
```python
# Multiple cleanup triggers
atexit.register(self.cleanup_on_exit)  # Automatic cleanup
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_exit)  # Ctrl+C handling
popup_button.clicked.connect(self.shutdown_from_popup)  # Popup shutdown
```

### Prerequisites
- macOS (uses AppKit and menu bar APIs)
- Python 3.8 or later
- Chrome browser (for bot features)

### Installation
1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üÜï Recent Improvements

### July 2024
- **Enhanced Chat Automation:**
  - Improved chat panel opening with precise clicking strategy that targets the "Chat" text element specifically
  - Eliminated side effects like unintended highlighting of other UI elements
  - Streamlined UI with single "Open Chat" button for better user experience
  - Enhanced reliability for opening chat panels in Zoom meetings
- **Code Optimization:**
  - Removed redundant chat opening methods and thread classes
  - Simplified button management and enabling/disabling logic
  - Improved code maintainability and reduced complexity

### June 2024
- **Robust Chat Automation:**
  - The bot now uses a highly specific selector for the Zoom chat button (`footer-button__button` with label `Chat`), ensuring it never clicks the screen share button by mistake.
  - The chat button is only clicked if its `aria-label` is `open the chat panel`, so the bot will not toggle or close the chat unnecessarily.
  - Sending a message as the bot will never trigger the screen sharing dialog.
  - Improved reliability for sending chat messages in Zoom meetings.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed an issue where sending a message could accidentally open the screen sharing dialog due to a broad selector.
  - Enhanced the message sending logic to only interact with the correct chat input box.
