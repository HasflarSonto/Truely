- Experimental automation features may be blocked by macOS security

### Bot Joiner
- Requires Chrome browser to be installed
- May be detected as automation by some meeting platforms
- Depends on web interface stability
- May not work with all meeting configurations
- Requires meeting access permissions

## üÜï Recent Improvements

### July 2024
- **Enhanced Chat Automation:**
  - Improved chat panel opening with precise clicking strategy that targets the "Chat" text element specifically
  - Eliminated side effects like unintended highlighting of other UI elements
  - Streamlined UI with single "Open Chat" button for better user experience
  - Enhanced reliability for opening chat panels in Zoom meetings
- **Code Optimization:**
  - Removed redundant chat opening methods and thread classes
  - Simplified button management and enabling/disabling logic
  - Improved code maintainability and reduced complexity

### June 2024
- **Robust Chat Automation:**
  - The bot now uses a highly specific selector for the Zoom chat button (`footer-button__button` with label `Chat`), ensuring it never clicks the screen share button by mistake.
  - The chat button is only clicked if its `aria-label` is `open the chat panel`, so the bot will not toggle or close the chat unnecessarily.
  - Sending a message as the bot will never trigger the screen sharing dialog.
  - Improved reliability for sending chat messages in Zoom meetings.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed an issue where sending a message could accidentally open the screen sharing dialog due to a broad selector.
  - Enhanced the message sending logic to only interact with the correct chat input box.
