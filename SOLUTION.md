# Truely App Location Services Crash Fix

## Problem
The Truely app was crashing with a segmentation fault due to Qt location services initialization. The crash occurred in the `warmUpLocationServices()` function in `QtCore.abi3.so` during PyQt6 import.

## Root Cause
The crash was happening because:
1. PyQt6 was trying to initialize location services during import
2. The location services modules were not properly disabled
3. Environment variables weren't being set early enough in the process

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated PyInstaller Spec File (`truely.spec`)
- Added comprehensive exclusion list for all Qt location-related modules
- Added environment variables to Info.plist to disable location services at the system level
- Excluded specific location plugins and modules that cause crashes

### 2. Enhanced Runtime Hook (`hook-disable-location.py`)
- Added more aggressive environment variable settings
- Disabled accessibility services that might interfere
- Added plugin path restrictions

### 3. Updated Main Application (`truely_dual_join.py`)
- Added environment variables at the very beginning, before any imports
- Disabled all location-related services comprehensively
- Added plugin path restrictions

## Key Changes Made

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
QT_DISABLE_LOCATION=1
QT_DISABLE_POSITIONING=1
QT_DISABLE_LOCATION_SERVICES=1
QT_DISABLE_LOCATION_PERMISSION=1
# ... and many more location-related variables
```

### Modules Excluded
```python
'PyQt6.QtLocation',
'PyQt6.QtPositioning',
'qtlocation',
'qtpositioning',
'qdarwinpermissionplugin_location',
# ... and many more
```

### Info.plist Environment Variables
Added `LSEnvironment` section with all location service disable flags.

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild the Application
```bash
cd /Users/antonioli/Desktop/Truely
pyinstaller truely.spec
```

### 2. Test the Application
```bash
# Test with the simple test script
python3 test_app_simple.py

# Or test manually
./distribution/Truely.app/Contents/MacOS/Truely
```

### 3. Verify the Fix
The app should now:
- Start without crashing
- Show the main window
- Display "ðŸ¤– Automated Monitoring: Inactive" status
- Not show any location-related errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **No Crash**: The app should start without segmentation fault
2. **Main Window**: Should display the Truely interface
3. **Status**: Should show automated monitoring status
4. **Process Monitoring**: Should work normally for detecting suspicious processes
5. **Zoom Integration**: Should work for dual-join functionality

## Troubleshooting

If the app still crashes:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   echo $QT_DISABLE_LOCATION
   ```

2. **Check PyInstaller Build**:
   ```bash
   ls -la distribution/Truely.app/Contents/Frameworks/
   ```

3. **Check for Location Plugins**:
   ```bash
   find distribution/Truely.app -name "*location*" -o -name "*positioning*"
   ```

4. **Run with Debug Output**:
   ```bash
   ./distribution/Truely.app/Contents/MacOS/Truely 2>&1 | head -20
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `truely.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
2. `hook-disable-location.py` - Runtime hook for environment variables
3. `truely_dual_join.py` - Main application with early environment setup
4. `test_app_simple.py` - Simple test script

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Setting environment variables before any PyQt6 imports
2. Excluding location-related modules from the PyInstaller bundle
3. Adding system-level environment variables in Info.plist
4. Using runtime hooks to ensure environment variables are set early

This comprehensive approach should prevent the location services crash and allow the Truely app to run normally.
